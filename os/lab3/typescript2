[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mps[0m [[4moptions[24m][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mps[0m displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed[m
       information, use [4mtop[24m(1) instead.[m
[m
       This version of [1mps[0m accepts several kinds of options:[m
[m
       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.[m
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.[m
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.[m
[m
       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical,[m
       due to the many standards and [1mps[0m implementations that this [1mps[0m is compatible with.[m
[m
       Note that "[1mps[0m [1m-aux[0m" is distinct from "[1mps[0m [1maux[0m".  The POSIX and UNIX standards require that "[1mps[0m [1m-aux[0m" print all processes owned by a user named[m
       "x", as well as printing all processes that would be selected by the [1m-a[0m option.  If the user named "x" does not exist, this [1mps[0m may interpret the[m
       command as "[1mps[0m [1maux[0m" instead and print a warning.  This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits.  It is fragile,[m
       subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.[m
[m
       By default, [1mps[0m selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal as the[m
       invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss[m
       format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.[m
[m
       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the[m
       executable name.  You can override this with the [1mPS_FORMAT[0m environment variable.  The use of BSD-style options will also change the process[m
       selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to be[m
       the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered when options[m
       are described as being "identical" below, so [1m-M[0m will be considered identical to [1mZ[0m and so on.[m
[m
       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added[m
       to the set of processes to be displayed.  A process will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mat[0m and [1mbatch[0m read commands from standard input or a specified file which are to be executed at a later time, using [1m/bin/sh[0m.[m
[m
       [1mat[0m      executes commands at a specified time.[m
[m
       [1matq[0m     lists  the  user's  pending  jobs, unless the user is the superuser; in that case, everybody's jobs are listed.  The format of the output[m
               lines (one for each job) is: Job number, date, hour, queue, and username.[m
[m
       [1matrm[0m    deletes jobs, identified by their job number.[m
[m
       [1mbatch[0m   executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words, when the load average drops below 1.5, or the value  specified  in  the[m
               invocation of [1matd[0m.[m
[m
       [1mAt[0m allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard.  It accepts times of the form [1mHH:MM[0m to run a job at a specific time[m
       of day.  (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)  You may also specify [1mmidnight,[0m [1mnoon,[0m or [1mteatime[0m (4pm) and you can have a time-[m
       of-day  suffixed with [1mAM[0m or [1mPM[0m for running in the morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the[m
       form [1mmonth-name[0m [1mday[0m with an optional [1myear,[0m or giving a date of the form [4mMMDD[24m[[4mCC[24m][4mYY[24m, [4mMM[24m/[4mDD[24m/[[4mCC[24m][4mYY[24m, [4mDD[24m.[4mMM[24m.[[4mCC[24m][4mYY[24m or [[4mCC[24m][4mYY[24m-[4mMM[24m-[4mDD[24m.   The  specifica‐[m
       tion  of  a date [4mmust[24m follow the specification of the time of day.  You can also give times like [1mnow[0m [1m+[0m [4mcount[24m [4mtime-units,[24m where the time-units can[m
       be [1mminutes,[0m [1mhours,[0m [1mdays,[0m or [1mweeks[0m and you can tell [1mat[0m to run the job today by suffixing the time with [1mtoday[0m and to run the job tomorrow  by  suf‐[m
       fixing the time with [1mtomorrow.[0m[m
[m
       For  example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, you would do [1mat[0m [1m4pm[0m [1m+[0m [1m3[0m [1mdays,[0m to run a job at 10:00am on July 31, you would do [1mat[0m [1m10am[0m [1mJul[0m[m
       [1m31[0m and to run a job at 1am tomorrow, you would do [1mat[0m [1m1am[0m [1mtomorrow.[0m[m
